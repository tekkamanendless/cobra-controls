# Cobra Controls
This suite of tools deals with the Cobra Controls ACP-T Series (typically sold before 2016).

Using this, you should be able to completely ignore the Windows software that the company provides (but no longer updates).

## Development
The `view-packets` tool requires `libpcap-dev` on Ubuntu systems.

```
sudo apt install libpcap-dev
```
